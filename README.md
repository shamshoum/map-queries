# map-queries

This is a little plugin for atom that maps media queries inside css files.

It helps you manage all of your media queries so you won't be overwhelmed.

I will try to update the package regularly with UI and functionality changes.

Currently a default key binding of ctrl-alt-o is assigned for mapping a css file,
you can click on results and it will take you to the line of the clicked media query.

If you want any more features added to this package or any ideas what to do next,
don't hesitate to open an issue about it.

### Changelog:
- Fixed display issue by adding a scrollbar
- Changed styling to look more familier

### ToDo:
- Close plugin on query select
- Add search bar
